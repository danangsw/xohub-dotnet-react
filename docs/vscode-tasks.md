### Method 4: Status Bar

- Look for the **Tasks** button in the status bar
- Click to see available tasks

## Task Configuration

### Task Groups

Tasks are organized into groups for easy access:

- **build**: Build and compilation tasks
- **test**: Testing and coverage tasks

### Task Properties

#### Basic Properties

```json
{
  "label": "task-name",
  "command": "executable",
  "type": "process" | "shell",
  "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
  "options": {
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/subfolder"
  }
}
```

#### Advanced Properties

```json
{
  "group": "build",
  "presentation": {
    "echo": true,
    "reveal": "always",
    "focus": false,
    "panel": "shared"
  },
  "problemMatcher": "$msCompile",
  "isBackground": false
}
```

### Environment Variables

```json
{
  "options": {
    "env": {
      "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
      "ASPNETCORE_URLS": "http://localhost:5000"
    }
  }
}
```

## Task Dependencies

### Sequential Execution

```json
{
  "label": "build-and-test",
  "dependsOn": ["build-backend", "test-backend"],
  "dependsOrder": "sequence"
}
```

### Parallel Execution

```json
{
  "label": "dev-full-stack",
  "dependsOn": ["watch-backend", "dev-frontend"],
  "dependsOrder": "parallel"
}
```

## Background Tasks

Tasks marked with `"isBackground": true` run continuously:

- `watch-backend`: Auto-rebuilds on file changes
- `dev-frontend`: Runs development server
- `test-backend-watch`: Auto-runs tests on changes
- `docker-logs`: Follows container logs

## Problem Matchers

Tasks use problem matchers to parse errors and warnings:

- `$msCompile`: .NET compiler errors
- `$tsc`: TypeScript compiler errors
- `$eslint-stylish`: ESLint output

## Code Coverage Workflow

### Quick Coverage Check

```bash
# Run tests with coverage collection
coverage-backend

# Generate HTML report
coverage-report
```

### Complete Coverage Analysis

```bash
# Run full coverage workflow
coverage-full
```

### Coverage Report Location

- **HTML Report**: `tests/TicTacToe.Server.Tests/TestResults/CoverageReport/index.html`
- **Raw Data**: `tests/TicTacToe.Server.Tests/TestResults/*/coverage.cobertura.xml`

## Development Workflows

### Full Development Setup

```bash
# Start both backend and frontend in development mode
dev-full-stack
```

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build entire stack
build-full-stack

# Or build with Docker
docker-up-build
```

### Testing Workflow

```bash
# Run all tests
test-full-stack

# Or run with coverage
coverage-full
```

## Custom Keybindings

Add to `keybindings.json` for quick access:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+t",
    "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
    "args": "test-backend"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+d",
    "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
    "args": "dev-full-stack"
  }
]
```

## Task Output and Monitoring

### Terminal Panel

- Shows real-time command output
- Background tasks run in dedicated terminals
- Tasks can be reused or run in new terminals

### Problems Panel

- Compiler errors and warnings
- Parsed from task output using problem matchers
- Click to navigate to source locations

### Task Management

- View running tasks in Terminal panel
- Stop background tasks with trash icon
- Restart tasks as needed

## Best Practices

### Task Organization

1. Use descriptive labels
2. Group related tasks together
3. Set appropriate default tasks
4. Use dependencies for complex workflows

### Performance

1. Use background tasks for watchers
2. Configure appropriate problem matchers
3. Set proper working directories
4. Use parallel execution when possible

### Error Handling

1. Configure problem matchers for error parsing
2. Use appropriate presentation settings
3. Set up proper environment variables
4. Handle task failures gracefully

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Task not found

- Check `tasks.json` syntax
- Ensure task label is correct
- Restart VS Code

### Command not found

- Verify executable is in PATH
- Check working directory
- Ensure dependencies are installed

#### Background task not stopping

- Use Terminal panel to stop manually
- Check task configuration
- Restart VS Code

### Debug Tasks

1. Run task manually in terminal first
2. Check task output in Terminal panel
3. Verify environment variables
4. Test with simplified commands

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Tasks

Add new tasks to `.vscode/tasks.json`:

```json
{
  "label": "custom-task",
  "command": "your-command",
  "args": ["--flag", "value"],
  "options": {
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "env": {
      "CUSTOM_VAR": "value"
    }
  },
  "group": "build",
  "presentation": {
    "echo": true,
    "reveal": "always"
  }
}
```

### Task Variables

- `${workspaceFolder}`: Project root
- `${file}`: Current file
- `${relativeFile}`: Relative path to current file
- `${workspaceFolderBasename}`: Project name

### Conditional Tasks

Use `runOptions` for platform-specific tasks:

```json
{
  "runOptions": {
    "runOn": "folderOpen"
  }
}
```
